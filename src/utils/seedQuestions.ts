        options: ["Integer", "Boolean", "String", "Array"],
        correct_answer: 3,
        explanation: "Array is a composite data type that holds multiple values, while Integer, Boolean, and String are primitive types that hold single values."
      },

        question: "What does 'DRY' principle stand for in programming?",
        options: ["Don't Repeat Yourself", "Data Requires Yielding", "Direct Resource Yielding", "Dynamic Resource Yielding"],
        correct_answer: 0,
        explanation: "DRY stands for 'Don't Repeat Yourself' - a principle that encourages reducing repetition in code by abstracting common functionality."

        question: "Which of these is the correct way to declare a constant in most C-style languages?",

        correct_answer: 1,
        explanation: "The 'const' keyword is used to declare constants in most C-style languages like JavaScript, C++, and others."

        options: ["O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(nÂ²)", "O(1)"],
        correct_answer: 1,
        explanation: "Binary search has O(log n) time complexity because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step."

        question: "Which sorting algorithm has the best average-case time complexity?",
        options: ["Bubble Sort", "Selection Sort", "Merge Sort", "Insertion Sort"],

        explanation: "Merge Sort has O(n log n) time complexity in all cases (best, average, and worst), making it consistently efficient."

        correct_answer: 1,
        explanation: "Stack follows LIFO principle where the last element added is the first one to be removed."
